## :package: Installation

### First check if you have YARN installed

Before installing this Readme Generator you need to check if you have `Node.js`and `YARN` installed on your computer.

To check if you have `Node.js` installed, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#then-install-the-readme-generator).

```sh
v10.18.0
```

To confirm that you have `YARN` installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#then-install-the-readme-generator).

```sh
1.21.1
```

If `Node.js` or `YARN` is not installed you can install them on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Don't forget to update `YARN` after installing `Node.js`:
